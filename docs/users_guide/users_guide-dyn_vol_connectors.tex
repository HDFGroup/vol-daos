HDF5 has the capability to dynamically load and use a VOL connector for running applications with.

In order to choose a particular VOL connector to use, two initial steps must be taken. First, one must help HDF5 locate the VOL connector by pointing to the directory which contains the built library. This can be accomplished by setting the environment variable \texttt{HDF5\_PLUGIN\_PATH} to this directory. Next, HDF5 needs to know the name of which library to use, which is configured by setting the environment variable \texttt{HDF5\_VOL\_CONNECTOR} to the name of the connector.

In order to use the DAOS VOL connector, the aforementioned environment variables should be set as:

\begin{verbatim}
HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=/daos/vol/installation/directory/lib
HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR=daos
\end{verbatim}

Having completed this step, HDF5 will be setup to load the DAOS VOL connector and use it for running applications, including HDF5's own tests. While several HDF5 tests have been updated to take advantage of this capability, please be aware that many of these tests are likely to fail or crash due to their native HDF5-specific nature.
